<br><br>
		My good posture is confident coz I had to learn that. I cry when I need to coz I had to learn that. I’m able to say no, coz I had to learn how to love myself more. I’m strategic coz I had to learn objective thinking. I’m free spirited coz I had to teach myself freedom. I’m in touch with myself coz I had to define spirituality for myself. I have a presence because I had to learn how to speak with conviction. I’m a hard nut to crack because I finessed myself out of my naivety. Most importantly I am me because I continue to choose, to choose… to keep falling in love with myself.
<br><br>
        I, am a phenomenal woman.
        …And, it is such a profound feeling to realize I’m becoming the woman I wanted to be.</p>
